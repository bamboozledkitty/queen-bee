# Changelog

All notable changes to Queen Bee are listed here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A terminal installer, `scripts/install.sh`, that fetches the latest release, checks its signature and installs it without the Gatekeeper prompt.
- A first-run walk-through of agents, logic cards and the orchestrator, which also checks that Claude Code is installed and new enough. **Help → Welcome to Queen Bee** shows it again.
- Undo and redo for every change to a flow, including the orchestrator's, from the Edit menu.
- Selecting several cards with Shift-click or a dragged box. Selected cards move, nudge with the arrow keys, duplicate, copy, paste and delete together.
- Dragged cards line up with nearby cards, with a guide line, or settle on the grid. Option places a card freely.
- Right-click menus on cards, links and the canvas.
- Escape deselects, ⌃⌘S shows or hides the projects list, and ⌥⌘0 the side panel.
- The run log, End-card output and the last run's marks are kept between launches, with a Clear button on the log.
- Notifications when a card needs you or a run ends while the app is in the background, with a setting to turn them off.
- Below 50% zoom, cards show their name and state in large type.

### Fixed

- The app's own message, such as Claude Code not being found, can be dismissed with a click.

### Changed

- Zooming from the zoom control, the menu, fit and a double-click on a card's title is animated. Hover, selection and panel changes ease instead of snapping.
- A link being dragged previews the route it will take, and lands on the input of a card that would accept it.
- The card settings panel is rebuilt: the name is edited in its header, settings sit in ruled rows, and Delete and the session's Start or Restart share a footer.
- Clicking into a terminal no longer opens that card's settings. Click the card's title for those.
- An empty flow shows a small note pointing at the orchestrator in place of the box in the middle of the canvas. Closing it is remembered.
- Floating panels no longer cast a shadow.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-09

### Fixed

- **Queen Bee → Check for Updates…** was always greyed out. It now turns on once the updater is ready.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-09

First public release.

### Added

- A canvas of cards joined by links. Agent cards are live Claude Code sessions in terminals you can type into.
- Logic cards that route each agent's finished reply: Start, If / Else, Switch, And, Or, Prompt, Loop until, End and Note.
- An orchestrator session beside the canvas that can build, edit, run and steer the flow.
- Runs with a log, per-card pass counts, live link marking and saved End-card output.
- Project folders in a sidebar, with flows saved in `<project>/.queenbee/flows/`.
- Light and dark appearance, and an app icon that follows it.
- Updates: the app checks for new versions and installs them, and **Queen Bee → Check for Updates…** checks on demand.

### Security

- A folder that already contains flows is only opened after you confirm you trust it.
- Cards can only use the permission modes the app offers. A mode that skips permission checks is refused from flow files and from the orchestrator's tools.
- Each session gets its own secret for talking to the app, and only the orchestrator's session can use the flow-editing tools.
- An End card's save path can't leave the project folder through a symlink.
- The test harness is compiled out of release builds.
- Releases are signed with a Developer ID and use the hardened runtime. They are not yet notarized by Apple.
