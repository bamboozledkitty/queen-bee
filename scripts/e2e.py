"""End-to-end checks of the built app, driven through its test harness.

Launches a separate test copy of Queen Bee (`--testing`, its own support folder, so a copy
you have open is left alone), opens a scratch project with one flow per scenario, runs real
Claude Code sessions on Haiku, and checks what the app did.
